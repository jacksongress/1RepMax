App description:
I want to create a weightlifting tracking app that also has a social sharing component.

App flow and functionality:
The flow of the app is as follows:

User opens the app, and there is a button that says start workout. There is also a small button that allows you to open up your profile, which will be used to add friends.
When the user clicks on the start workout button, the user gets to add different workouts to their workout and a timer starts.
The user can add specific lifts to their workout in a list like order. For each lift, the user can add sets and reps and a specific weight for each set.

After the user is finished inputting all their lifts and sets. They press end workout and the data from the workout is saved into the Firebase Firestone database.

Now, the app displays all previous workouts in a history tab on the homepage.

This application is set-up with the existing configuration Firebase. Implement all the functionality in the flow above while using the existing codebase as a starting point, but fully modify the codebase to fit the flow and functionality described above.
